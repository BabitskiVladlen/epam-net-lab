Simple Web Application supports following features:

1) AsyncHandler:
a) handles .jhtm extension. Files of this extension may contain ordinal html as well as also json
b) asynchronous writing data about user's web-browser and device to file on a server

2) RequestResult:
abstract class containing service information such as http-context and requesting page. Also it supports abstract method GetResponse().
Derivative classes handle requests and return responses with corresponding status codes. These classes use lowâ€“level classes DefaultStrategy and Response.  

3) Security API:
a) login/logoff
b) current user
c) creating, reading, deleting of cookies
d) creating and verification of a password (md5)
e) http-module, whose methods are hooked up on AuthenticationRequest and EndOfRequest events to authentication problems (using IPrincipal and IIdentity interfaces)

4) JavaScript features:
a) dynamical changing elements sizes
b) AJAX (all pages):
- login form
- validation
- home page
- user's info (JSON)
- not found page

5) CSS
all styles, background image (is created from 1px), logotype

Also I used NLog framework for errors handling.
